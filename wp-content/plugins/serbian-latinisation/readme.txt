== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use your plugin to transliterate my latin content into cyrillic? =

Short answer: no.

Long Answer: No. Such conversions are very hard to do since HTML language is also written in latin script, and converting text only is very resource intensive process.

= Will this plugin transliterate my page title into latin as well? =

Yes, it will.

= Will this plugin enable my visitors to search for content using latin script =

Yes it will. Plugin hooks into default WordPress search function and enables searching of cyrilic content using latin text on frontend

= Is this plugin Compatible with WPML =

Yes it is. It has no compatibility issues with WPML, since the transliteration core is being used only in serbian version of the website

= Will I be able to select script for Serbian language in WPML language Widget? =

Yes, Plugin fully integrates with all WPML functions on the frontend because it directly extends the available language list

= I'm having search issues - not all posts show up when searching for them using latin characters = 

Open a support thread, or send me an e-mail.

= Your plugin is converting my cyrilic filenames into latin which prevents them from loading = 

First of all - you shouldn't be using cyrilic filenames in the first place. Due to the fact that most hosting providers do not have full UTF-8 support.

An easy fix is to redownload all attachments with cyrilic filenames and reupload them. This plugin will do an on-the-fly conversion of filenames.

= Some parts of my page aren't being transliterated =

Depending on the theme / plugins you're currently using, some content might be generated via javascript / ajax. This plugin works fully on the backend side (content is being transliterated via PHP), so it cannot influence JS generated content and content pulled via ajax calls.

Feel free to contact me via e-mail, and I'll see if I can assist you for your specific case.
